## Task 1: Classification of Gamers

### Introduction to the Dataset
This dataset offers a comprehensive view of player behavior in online gaming environments. The goal is to predict player engagement levels—categorized as 'High', 'Medium', and 'Low'—using classification models. Insights from this analysis can enhance game design, marketing strategies, and player retention mechanisms.

### Objective
The primary objective is to build classification models to predict player engagement levels (High, Medium, Low).

### Result
- A summary of the classification performance of KNN and Random Forest algorithms.
- Detailed discussion on the strengths, weaknesses, and suitability of each model for this dataset.
- Recommendations based on the results to optimize gaming strategies.
